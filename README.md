# Local Fork

This is a development fork investigating getting everything to build under the open source FPGA toolchain.

It is a work in progress.  Things are starting to build, but have not been tested and timing looks like it's not quite there yet.

1. Install yosys, icestorm, nextpnr-icestorm, and verilator
2. run `make vera-module` in the fpga directory
